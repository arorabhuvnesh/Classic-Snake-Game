# Classic-Snake-Game
In this project, the player controls snake movements by changing its direction. Snake automatically moves forward in the current direction. To collect a piece of fruit, the player has to move through it by directing the snake's head to the piece. The player also has to avoid bombs in the path, they will reduce the size of the snake and the game score as well.

Challenge is to eat more and more fruits without getting out of the boundary, with the primary goal to survive as much as possible. How long can you last before your tail becomes your dinner?
